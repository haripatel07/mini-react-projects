## About the Repository

This repository is a growing collection of mini-applications built using React.js. The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience with fundamental React concepts such as state management (`useState`, `useEffect`), props, component composition, event handling, and conditional rendering, while creating practical and fun tools.

## Features

* **Modular Design:** Each project is a self-contained React application.
* **Fundamental React Concepts:** Focus on core React hooks and patterns.
* **Interactive UIs:** User-friendly interfaces for practical applications.
* **Responsive Design:** (Where applicable) Designed to look good on various screen sizes.
* **Live Demos:** (Optional: You can add links to Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages demos for each project)
